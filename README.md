# student-performance

## Introduction

IN THIS NOTEBOOK/PROJECT WE WILL ANALYSE THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS BASED VARIOUS FEATURES SUCH AS GENDER , PARENT'S BACKGROUND AND STATUS OF TEST PREPARATIONS

WE WILL ANALYSE EACH COLUMN WITH THE HELP OF VISULAIZATIONS

WHAT WE WILL DO?

WE WILL ANALYSE WHICH GENDER IS PERFORMED BETTER
CAN WE PRESUME STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE BASED ON HIS/HER RACE OR ETHNICITY?
DOES PARENT'S EDUCATION BACKGROUND MATTERS?
DOES STANDARD OF LUNCH MAKE DIFFERENCE IN STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE?
WILL STUDENT PERFORM GOOD IS HE PREPARED FOR THE EXAM OR NOT? AND VICE VERSA

## DATASET 

GENDER : Gender of students

RACE/ETHNICITY : Which social group or race student is related to

PARENTAL LEVEL OF EDUCATION : Background of parent's education

LUNCH : Standard of lunch

TEST PREPARATION COURSE : student is prepared or not

MATH,READING AND WRITING SCORE : marks secured by students


### I have also deployed this small project using heroku 
1. Which will give us student's marks out of 300 (MATHS , READING and WRITING score i.e. each 100)
2. Please have look on this link : https://student-performanceanalysis.herokuapp.com/
